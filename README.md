# TicTacToe

TicTacToe game i implemented using Java with the purpose of learning the language.
I implemented the opponent AI using the Minimax algorithm.  This algorithm was covered in "Fundamentals of artificial intelligence and its applications" course i took this semester.

The game has no graphics except for basic terminal outputs:

The project has several classes:
* Main.java - Calls the relevant methods (basically controls the game).
* TicTacToe.java - The game class, creates and maintains the game board.
* MinimaxPlayer.java - A opponent class that uses the Minimax algorithm to make the next move.
* RndPlayer.java - A opponent class that chooses the next move randomly.
